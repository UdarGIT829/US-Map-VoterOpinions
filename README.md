# US Map Voter Opinions

This project will provide visualizations for voter data across states and counties.

Additionally, it will provide functionality to visualize polling data.

By combining polling data and voter demographics, it will use Multivariate Regression techniques to extrapolate opinions in non-polled regions to predict opinions across the nation based on regional demographics.
